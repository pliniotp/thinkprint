"""
This package contains the backend implementation for the serverless
deployment of ThinkPrint on Vercel.  It mirrors the structure of the
monolithic ``backend`` module in the root of the repository but is
selfâ€‘contained so that Vercel can import it without referencing files
outside of the ``vercel-backend`` directory.
