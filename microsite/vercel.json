  // Because this application is a single page app (SPA) built with
  // React and Vite, the front‑end handles client‑side routing.  To
  // ensure that direct navigations to nested routes (e.g.
  // `/register?event=...` or `/gallery/<token>`) are served by
  // `index.html` rather than a 404 page, we configure a rewrite for
  // all unmatched paths back to the root.  This allows the SPA to
  // interpret the URL and render the correct view.
